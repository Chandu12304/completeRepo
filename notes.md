## 1. Problem Statement

**Problem:**  
Many people have unused items (clothes, books, gadgets, etc.) that could be donated, resold, or organized, but there’s no simple, unified platform to facilitate this process. As a result, valuable resources go to waste, and people who need these items miss out.

## 2. How Your Website Solves the Problem

**Solution:**  
Your website, "Binary Coders," provides a platform where users can:
- **Donate, sell, or resell** items (clothes, books, gadgets, etc.).
- **Organize** their items and manage listings.
- **Connect** with others who need or want these items.
- **Stay updated** with the latest news and trends related to sustainability and reuse.

This helps reduce waste, promotes sustainability, and makes it easy for users to give or get items.

```

### **Key Code Functionalities**

- **server.js**:  
  - Sets up the Express server.
  - Connects to the database.
  - Serves static files and EJS views.
  - Uses routers for handling different endpoints.

- **config/db.js**:  
  - Handles the connection to the database (likely MongoDB or MySQL, depending on the code).

- **routes/routeHandlers.js**:  
  - Defines the main API endpoints (e.g., for login, signup, item upload, etc.).

- **controlers/routeControlers.js**:  
  - Contains the logic for each route (e.g., handling form submissions, file uploads, user authentication).

- **public/**:  
  - **css/**: Styles for dashboards, home, real-time chat, etc.
  - **js/**: Client-side scripts for interactivity (chatbot, dashboard, notifications).
  - **images/**: Used for avatars, backgrounds, and item images.

- **views/**:  
  - EJS templates for rendering dynamic pages (login, dashboard, chat, etc.).

- **uploads/**:  
  - Stores user-uploaded files, organized by user/email.

## 4. Database

- **config/db.js** is responsible for connecting to the database.
- The database is used to store:
  - **User information** (authentication, profiles)
  - **Item listings** (clothes, books, gadgets, etc.)
  - **Uploaded files** (images of items)
  - **Messages** (for real-time chat, if implemented)
- The exact database (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.) can be confirmed by checking `db.js` and `package.json` for dependencies like `mongoose` or `mysql`.

## 5. Interview Perspective Questions & Answers

### **A. Project & Architecture**

**Q1: What problem does your project solve?**  
A: It provides a platform for people to donate, resell, or organize unused items, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.

**Q2: How is your project structured?**  
A: It uses a modular structure with separate folders for configuration, controllers, routes, public assets, views, and uploads. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, and the frontend uses EJS templates and static assets.

**Q3: How does the backend communicate with the frontend?**  
A: The backend serves EJS templates and static files. It also exposes API endpoints for AJAX requests from the frontend.

**Q4: How are file uploads handled?**  
A: Uploaded files are stored in the `uploads/` directory, organized by user/email.

---

### **B. Tech Stack**

**Q5: What technologies did you use and why?**  
A:  
- **Node.js & Express:** For building a scalable, fast backend.
- **EJS:** For server-side rendering of dynamic pages.
- **CSS/JS:** For frontend styling and interactivity.
- **Database (MongoDB/MySQL):** For storing user and item data.
- **Render:** For free hosting and deployment.

**Q6: How do you manage user authentication?**  
A: Likely using sessions or JWTs (check the code for details). User data is stored in the database, and authentication logic is in the controllers.

**Q7: How do you ensure security in file uploads?**  
A: By storing uploads in a dedicated directory and likely validating file types and sizes in the upload logic.

---

### **C. Features & Functionality**

**Q8: What are the main features of your website?**  
A:  
- User authentication (login/signup)
- Item listing (donate, resell, organize)
- File uploads (images of items)
- Real-time chat (if implemented)
- News/blog section
- Responsive dashboards

**Q9: How does the real-time chat work?**  
A: Likely uses WebSockets or polling (check `RealTimeChat.ejs` and related JS files).

---

### **D. Deployment & Maintenance**

**Q10: How is your project deployed?**  
A: Hosted on Render. The code is pushed to GitHub, and Render pulls from the repo to deploy.

**Q11: How do you keep the server awake on Render?**  
A: By using a GitHub Actions workflow that pings the server every 14 minutes to prevent it from sleeping.

---

### **E. General Tech Questions**

**Q12: What is Express.js and why use it?**  
A: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies routing, middleware, and server setup.

**Q13: What is EJS?**  
A: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

**Q14: How do you serve static files in Express?**  
A: By using `express.static()` middleware, e.g., `app.use(express.static('public'))`.

**Q15: How do you connect Node.js to a database?**  
A: By using a database driver or ORM (like `mongoose` for MongoDB or `mysql` for MySQL), and initializing the connection in a config file.
